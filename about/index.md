## Visualization of Changes in Stock Correlations for the S&P500 dataset
We want to develop a script to scrape the information for the stock prices from Yahoo Finance for the years 2008-2017.
Consequently, we would like to format the dataset to include the information of the change of annual returns of every stock 
by looking at initial and closing stock price. Then, we will proceed to calculate the correlation matrix for the 500 stocks and use some clustering method prior to visualizing it into a possible network. A possible objective would be to compare the different clusters/patterns over time. 

The Standard and Poor 500 is one of America’s stock market indexes and It is based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies. For those who don't know to buy a stock is to obtain a part of a corporation assets and earnings.

We were interested in data from 2008-2016 because during 2008 the US suffered the financial crisis, so we wanted to observe how the market was recuperating after that. 

Our objective was to explore the SP500 dataset by looking at the  relationships between stocks and observe the behavior of the market over time. Another objective was to select a set of stocks where it would be profitable to invest in.
